# Test::Fuzz
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FCO/Test-Fuzz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FCO/Test-Fuzz)

This module
performs
[generative testing]([https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2016/12/22/day-22-generative-testing/) on
PerlÂ 6 functions.

## Synopsis
```perl6
use lib ".";
use Test::Fuzz;

sub bla (Int $bla, Int $ble --> UInt) is fuzzed {
	$bla + $ble
}

sub ble (Int $ble) is fuzzed {
	die "it is prime!" if $ble.is-prime
}

sub bli (Str :$bli) is fuzzed {
	die "it's too long" unless $bli.chars < 10
}

sub blo ("test") is fuzzed {
	"ok"
}

sub blu (Str $blu) {
	"ok";
}

fuzz &blu;

multi MAIN(Bool :$fuzz!) {
	run-tests
}
```

## Description
`Test::Fuzz` is a tool
for
[*fuzzing* or generative/fuzz testing`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing).

Add the `is fuzzed` trait to a method or function and `Test::Fuzz`
will try to figure out the best generators to use to test your
function. If the function was already created without this trait, pass it to the `fuzz` function for the same effect.

To run the tests, just call the `run-tests` function.

## INSTALLATION

    > zef install Test::Fuzz

    # or, with 6pm (https://github.com/FCO/6pm)
